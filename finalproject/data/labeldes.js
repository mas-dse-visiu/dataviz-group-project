	1: "FBFM1 Surface fires that burn fine herbaceous fuels, cured and curing fuels, little shrub or timber present, primarily grasslands and savanna",
	2: "FBM2 Burns fine, herbaceous fuels, stand is curing or dead, may produce fire brands on oak or pine stands",
	3: "FBM3 Most intense fire of grass group, spreads quickly with wind, one third of stand dead or cured, stands average 3 ft tal",
	4: "FBM4 Fast spreading fire, continuous overstory, flammable foliage and dead woody material, deep litter layer can inhibit suppression",
	5: "FBM5 Low intensity fires, young, green shrubs with little dead material, fuels consist of litter from understory",
	6: "FBM6 Broad range of shrubs, fire requires moderate winds to maintain flame at shrub height, or will drop to the ground with low winds",
	7: "FBM7 Foliage highly flammable, allowing fire to reach shrub strata levels, shrubs generally 2 to 6 feet high",
	8: "FBM8 Slow, ground burning fires, closed canopy stands with short needle conifers or hardwoods, litter consist mainly of needles and leaves, with little undergrowth, occasional flares with concentrated fuels",
	9: "FBM9 Longer flames, quicker surface fires, closed canopy stands of long-needles or hardwoods, rolling leaves in fall can cause spotting, dead-down material can cause occasional crowning",
	10: "FBM10 Surface and ground fire more intense, dead-down fuels more abundant, frequent crowning and spotting causing fire control to be more difficult",
	11: "FBM11 Fairly active fire, fuels consist of slash and herbaceous materials, slash originates from light partial cuts or thinning projects, fire is limited by spacing of fuel load and shade from overstory",
	12: "FBM12 Rapid spreading and high intensity fires, dominated by slash resulting from heavy thinning projects and clearcuts, slash is mostly 3 inches or less ",
	13: "FBM13 Fire spreads quickly through smaller material and intensity builds slowly as large material ignites, continuous layer of slash larger than 3 inches in diameter predominates, resulting from clearcuts and heavy partial cuts, active flames sustained for long periods of time, fire is susceptible to spotting and weather conditions",
